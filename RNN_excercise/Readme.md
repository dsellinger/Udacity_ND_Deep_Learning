# char-rnn

This code implements **multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network** (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) for training/sampling from character-level language models.  In other words the model takes one text file as input and trains a Recurrent Neural Network that learns to predict the next character in a sequence. The RNN can then be used to generate text character by character that will look like the original training data. This example is based on Andrej Karpathy's (http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/, "post").
